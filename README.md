![DevSecOps](https://img.shields.io/badge/DevSecOps-Security%20Integrated-blue)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **integrating security into the DevOps pipeline** through **DevSecOps** practices. It ensures that security is a **continuous, automated, and seamless** part of software development, testing, and deployment. 

### 🎯 Key Objectives
✅ Secure coding practices 🔐  
✅ Automated security scans 🛠️  
✅ Vulnerability assessments 🕵️  
✅ Compliance checks 📜  
✅ Secure containerization 🐳  
✅ Infrastructure security ⚡

## 🏗️ **Project Phases**

### 📂 **Phase 1: Setting Up the CI/CD Pipeline**
🔹 Install & Configure **GitLab CI/CD or Jenkins**  
🔹 Set up **GitLab Runner or Jenkins Agent**  
🔹 Define the **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**  
🔹 Integrate security tools like **SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Trivy**  
🔹 Automate security checks at every stage  

---

### 🔍 **Phase 2: Implementing Security Scans**
🔹 Install and configure **SonarQube** for **static code analysis**  
🔹 Integrate SonarQube with the pipeline to **analyze code quality**  
🔹 Detect **security vulnerabilities & code smells** before deployment  
🔹 Ensure **coding standards compliance**  

---

### 🐳 **Phase 3: Secure Containerization**
🔹 Install **Docker Desktop**  
🔹 Create a **secure Dockerfile** for the application  
🔹 Perform **vulnerability scans** using **Trivy / Snyk**  
🔹 Implement **Aqua Security / Sysdig** for **runtime security**  
🔹 Define and enforce **container security policies**  

---

### 🔐 **Phase 4: Secrets Management & Security Testing**
🔹 Install **HashiCorp Vault** for **secrets management**  
🔹 Securely store and inject **API keys, passwords** dynamically  
🔹 Set up **OWASP ZAP** for automated security testing  
🔹 Perform penetration testing to detect **SQL Injection & XSS vulnerabilities**  
🔹 Monitor security logs and threats using **Sysdig / Aqua Security**

## 🎯 **Expected Outcomes**
✨ **Automated CI/CD Pipeline** with security integration ✅  
✨ **Hardened containerized applications** with zero known vulnerabilities 🚀  
✨ **Real-time security monitoring & compliance enforcement** 🔎  
✨ **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for automated & secure provisioning**
